# JsBlackjack

This is the development version of my JsBlackjack game, which is the classic card game Blackjack, built with JavaScript.

I've used this game as a code example in a number of Envato Tuts+ courses, but this version is separate and will be updated on a different frequency than the versions used elsewhere. The repositories are named after the courses for those other versions.

The biggest issue with this version is in the card dealing - players are dealt all of their cards in one go, rather than dealing 1 card to each player *n* times. I may or may not address this.

The cards, players, and deck are reasonably decoupled, so it should be possible to build other card games using the players, cards, and deck here.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
